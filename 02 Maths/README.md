C++ program releted to some basic mathematics concept

1.  Program to print number from 1 to n and also return their sum haing input n

        Input: n =5
        Output: 1 2 3 4 5
                Sum = 15

1.  Program to print fibonacci series upto n if we give a number n.

        Input: n = 5
        Output: 0 1 1 2 3

1.  Pogram to check given number 'n' is prime or not.
1.  Given an integer number n, return the difference between the product of its digits and the sum of its digits.

        Input: n = 234
        Output: 15

1.  Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

        Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
        Output: 3

1.  Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

        Input: x = 123
        Output: 321

        Input: x = -123
        Output: -321

1.  The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the 0's to 1's and all the 1's to 0's in its binary representation.

        Input: n = 5
        Output: 2

1.  Given decimal number n you have to return its binary.
1.  Given binary number n you have to return its decimal number.
1.  Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of two. Otherwise, return false.

        Input: n = 1
        Output: true

        Input: n = 16
        Output: true
